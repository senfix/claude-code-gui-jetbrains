## Highlights

- The **same UI/UX** as Claude Code in Cursor/VS Code, now in JetBrains IDEs
- A wrapper that spawns the Claude Code CLI — the same approach as the official VS Code extension
- **All source code designed and written entirely from scratch** — not a clone of any other project
- Dual-environment architecture that runs independently in **browsers/mobile** as well as JetBrains IDEs
- Delivers the rapidly evolving Claude Code experience (Agent Team, Remote Control, etc.) as a GUI

> We are currently putting significant effort into stabilizing the service. If you report a bug, we typically resolve it within 1 day on average. Your feedback and bug reports are greatly appreciated.
>
> This project aspires to grow alongside a global developer community. We adopt **English as the official common language** to maximize collaboration opportunities with as many developers as possible.

## Features

### Streaming Chat

- Real-time Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting (math rendering supported)
- Displays Claude's thinking process as it unfolds

### Tool Call Cards

- Dynamically loads other available commands

### Interrupt

- Instantly stop streaming messages and tool execution

### Tunnel and Sleep Prevention

- **Remote access from external devices**
  - Generates an externally accessible URL with QR Code
  - Tunnels local server using [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) by Cloudflare (free, unlimited)
  - No third-party communication beyond the Cloudflare proxy server providing port forwarding
  - Community-built feature, unrelated to Claude's native Remote Control (planned for future support)

- **Sleep prevention**
  - macOS (caffeinate), Linux (systemd-inhibit), Windows (powercfg)

### Bidirectional Settings Sync

- Control not only plugin settings but also Claude Code's original settings (global/local) directly from the settings menu
- Full GUI coverage of the official settings file spec is planned
- GUI management of MCP servers, skills, agents, and other `.claude` domains is planned

### Browser/Mobile Standalone

- Works standalone in browsers or mobile without JetBrains IDE
- Node.js backend provides a WebSocket server; the browser connects as a client
- Not just for development — an independent deployment target delivering the same features as the IDE environment

### Additional Features

- **Open Claude in Terminal** — Launch Claude in the IDE terminal from the command palette
- **Session URL Routing** — Sessions auto-restore even after IDE restart
- **Single Process Multi-Project** — One backend process serves multiple projects simultaneously
- **Settings** — Configure CLI path, theme, font size, permission policy, and log level
